# XO
Java implementation of the XO game (more commonly known as Tic-tac-toe). This game is programmed without GUI, so it relies on typed user input be played.

## Instructions

To play the game, simply compile all files and run Main.java.

```
javac *.java
java Main
```

To take a deeper look into how the code works, open the following files in order, and the comments in the files will walk you through the process:

```
1. Board.java
2. PlayerInput.java
3. WinCondition.java
4. Main.java
```

ArrayManipulation.java is not really that important--it exists simply because I need a class that allows me to manipulate arrays.
